## Reproduction case for gradle issue.

This repository represents a minimal reproduction case.
To validate the issue, run the following command:
    
    ```shell
    ./gradlew :Target:build
    ```

from the root directory.

If the error occurs then the result is a failed build with a FNFE for the greeting.jar generated by the master project.
If it succeeds it will output the contents of the greeting.txt that normally gets packaged into the greeting.jar.
